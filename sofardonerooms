DAY 12:
Use Atomic Transactions: The developer should have implemented atomic database transactions to ensure that all steps of a fund transfer (deducting and crediting balances) are performed as a single unit. This would ensure that either all steps of the transaction succeed or none do, preventing partial updates that could lead to an inconsistent state.
Implement Mutex Locks: By using Mutex Locks, the developer could have ensured that only one thread accesses the shared resource (such as the account balance) at a time. This would prevent multiple requests from interfering with each other during concurrent transactions.
Apply Rate Limits: The developer should have implemented rate limiting on critical functions like funds transfers and withdrawals. This would limit the number of requests processed within a specific time frame, reducing the risk of abuse through rapid, repeated requests.

DAY 13:
WebSocket Vulnerabilities

While WebSockets can boost performance, they also come with security risks that developers need to monitor. Since WebSocket connections stay open and active, they can be taken advantage of if the proper security measures aren't in place. Here are some common vulnerabilities:

    Weak Authentication and Authorisation: Unlike regular HTTP, WebSockets don't have built-in ways to handle user authentication or session validation. If you don't set these controls up properly, attackers could slip in and get access to sensitive data or mess with the connection.
    Message Tampering: WebSockets let data flow back and forth constantly, which means attackers could intercept and change messages if encryption isn't used. This could allow them to inject harmful commands, perform actions they shouldn't, or mess with the sent data.
    Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH): This happens when an attacker tricks a user's browser into opening a WebSocket connection to another site. If successful, the attacker might be able to hijack that connection or access data meant for the legitimate server.
    Denial of Service (DoS): Because WebSocket connections stay open, they can be targeted by DoS attacks. An attacker could flood the server with a ton of messages, potentially slowing it down or crashing it altogether.

DAY 14: Certificate Mismanagement:
what a certificate is:

    Public key: At its core, a certificate contains a public key, part of a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone and is used to encrypt data.
    Private key: The private key remains secret and is used by the website or server to decrypt the data.
    Metadata: Along with the key, it includes metadata that provides additional information about the certificate holder (the website) and the certificate. You usually find information about the Certificate Authority (CA), subject (information about the website, e.g. www.meow.thm), a uniquely identifiable number, validity period, signature, and hashing algorithm.

Sign Here, Trust Me

So what is a Certificate Authority (CA)?

A CA is a trusted entity that issues certificates; for example, GlobalSign, Let’s Encrypt, and DigiCert are very common ones. The browser trusts these entities and performs a series of checks to ensure it is a trusted CA. Here is a breakdown of what happens with a certificate:

    Handshake: Your browser requests a secure connection, and the website responds by sending a certificate, but in this case, it only requires the public key and metadata.
    Verification: Your browser checks the certificate for its validity by checking if it was issued by a trusted CA. If the certificate hasn’t expired or been tampered with, and the CA is trusted, then the browser gives the green light. There are different types of checks you can do; check them here.
    Key exchange: The browser uses the public key to encrypt a session key, which encrypts all communications between the browser and the website.
    Decryption: The website (server) uses its private key to decrypt the session key, which is symmetric. Now that both the browser and the website share a secret key (session key), we have established a secure and encrypted communication!

Ever wonder what makes HTTPS be S (secure)? Thanks to certificates, we can now have authentication, encryption, and data integrity.

Self-Signed Certificates vs. Trusted CA Certificates

The process of acquiring a certificate with a CA is long, you create the certificate, and send it to a CA to sign it for you. If you don’t have tools and automation in place, this process can take weeks. Self-signed certificates are signed by an entity usually the same one that authenticates. For example, Wareville owns the GiftScheduler site, and if they create a certificate and sign it with Wareville as a CA, that becomes a self-signed certificate.

    Browsers generally do not trust self-signed certificates because there is no third-party verification. The browser has no way of knowing if the certificate is authentic or if it’s being used for malicious purposes (like a man-in-the-middle attack).
    Trusted CA certificates, on the other hand, are verified by a CA, which acts as a trusted third party to confirm the website’s identity.

CA-issued certificates sometimes take a long time; if you want to test a development environment, it can make sense to use self-signed certificates. Ideally, this is an internal, air-gapped environment with no connection to the public Internet. Otherwise, it defeats the purpose of a certificate: the entire system of secure communication relies on the fact that both parties (the browser and the server) can trust the data being exchanged and that no one in the middle can intercept or modify it without detection.
